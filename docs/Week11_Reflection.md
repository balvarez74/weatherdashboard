‚úçÔ∏è Section 1: Week 11 Reflection
Answer each prompt with 3‚Äì5 bullet points:

Key Takeaways: What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?
    (1) It's very important to break the project down into digestible bits. This provides clarity due to the more in-depth brainstorming of each part.

    (2) The capstone has 4 components: core, 3 features, enhancement, and team portion

    (3) This project not only provides us with a learning opportunity, but also a portfolio piece (crucial when job hunting)

Concept Connections: Which Week 1‚Äì10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?
    (1) The skill(s) that feels strongest to me includes:
        - basics of functions (definition and parameters),
        - data structures (dictionaries, sets),
        - module importing,
        - essential programming concepts, including nested data structures.
        - pandas, matplotlib

    (2) The skills I need to practice more on include:
        - exception handling with try-except for debugging (I find this very intimidating),
        - fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes and class methods,
        - basic sorting algorithms (bubble and insertion sort),
        - efficient sorting methods (merge and quicksort),
        - searching techniques (binary and linear search)

Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?
    (1) setting up basic architecture of repo

    (2) setting up the week11_reflection.md file (homework instructions not as clear that the file needs to be in the weather-dashboard-brenda repo, initially, I spent a lot of time browsing through JTC's GitHub library looking for a docs/ folder)

    (3) creating my first repo was also a bit of a blocker but luckily, Patrick Snoop helped us get this setup on Monday or Tuesday of this week

Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?

üß† Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale
List three features + one enhancement you plan to build.

#	Feature Name	Difficulty (1‚Äì3)	Why You Chose It / Learning Goal
    (1)	Simple Statistics / 1 / I think I could complete this more easily than other options and realistically speaking, I don't want to burn myself out with this project + full-time job.		

    (2)	Weather History Tracker / 1 / I think I could complete this more easily than other options and realistically speaking, I don't want to burn myself out with this project + full-time job.	

    (3)	Temperature Graph / 2 / I find this one intriguing and fun. Plus helpful to see the weekly/monthly/annual trends.

Enhancement		‚Äì	
üß© Tip: Pick at least one ‚Äúlevel 3‚Äù feature to stretch your skills!
